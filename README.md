# DevOps CI/CD Automated Deployment to Azure Container Instances  

This repository demonstrates a **conceptual DevOps CI/CD workflow** for a containerized Spring Boot application using **Azure DevOps Pipelines** and **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**.  

It is designed for **educational and demonstration purposes**, showing how a typical enterprise DevOps workflow looks ‚Äì from code commit to automated deployment.  

‚úÖ It provides:

- A realistic setup for CI/CD pipelines

- Sample Docker & pipeline configs

- A structured workflow for Azure-based deployment

## üìú Project Overview
This project simulates the process of automating containerized application deployment with Azure services. It shows how:

- Code changes trigger a CI pipeline that builds and pushes a Docker image

- A CD pipeline deploys the image to Azure Container Instances

- The workflow integrates GitHub, Azure DevOps, and Docker

- Although no real deployment occurs here, the structure reflects industry-standard practices.

## üõ† Prerequisites
- For an actual Azure deployment, the following would be required:

- Azure Account to create Container Registry and Container Instances

- Azure DevOps Organization for CI/CD pipeline execution

- Docker Installed locally for building and testing container images

- For this demo project, no actual accounts or installations are required.

---

## üîÑ GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps CI/CD
This repository includes sample YAML pipeline configurations for CI and CD stages.

Continuous Integration (CI) simulates:

- Building the Spring Boot application

- Creating a Docker image

- Pushing the image to Azure Container Registry

Continuous Deployment (CD) simulates:

- Pulling the Docker image from ACR

- Deploying it to Azure Container Instances

- Confirming successful deployment

Sample CI pipeline configuration:

<pre>
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
  - script: echo "Building Spring Boot app..."
  - script: echo "Creating Docker image..."
  - script: echo "Pushing image to Azure Container Registry..." </pre>

  ---

## üê≥ Dockerization
++
The application is packaged as a Docker container using a simple Dockerfile.

It provides:

- A lightweight OpenJDK base image

- Placement of a sample Spring Boot JAR file

- A minimal ENTRYPOINT for running the container

Sample Dockerfile:

<pre>
  FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
COPY target/devops-demo.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
</pre>
This approach allows the application to run consistently in any environment.

---

## üåê Azure Deployment (Concept)
In a real-world setup, deployment would involve:

Authenticating to Azure

- Pushing the Docker image to Azure Container Registry

-    Creating an Azure Container Instance from the image

- Exposing the app via a DNS label

Example deployment commands:

<pre>
  az acr login --name myregistry
docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/devops-demo:latest

az container create \
  --name demoapp \
  --image myregistry.azurecr.io/devops-demo:latest \
  --dns-name-label demoapp \
  --ports 8080
</pre>
This project simulates the workflow without performing real deployments.

docker run -p 8080:8080 devops-demo
</pre>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Review CI/CD Pipelines

Open and review:

- azure-pipelines-ci.yml (Continuous Integration)

- azure-pipelines-cd.yml (Continuous Deployment)

4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Azure Authentication
If connecting to Azure (conceptually):

<pre>
az login
az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"
  </pre>

  ## üîó Next Steps & Contribution
This project is a conceptual demo for showcasing DevOps workflows.

If you want to extend it:

- Replace the sample Java app with a real application

- Integrate with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for actual CI/CD

- Deploy to a real Azure environment with Azure Container Instances

Feel free to fork, modify, and improve this project. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome
